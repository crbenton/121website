         Welcome to Mill 121, an ongoing project that we would like to share with you. This plot of land is known as Mill 121 because it is right next to the old 121 highway and features an old feed mill. Our two main goals for this old feed mill are to renovate the old buildings to share its unique history with others as well as reclamation of the old fields for hay production. Please explore our website to learn more and if you have any questions or comments feel free to contact us at: Mill121@gmail.com.
