           <p>The Philips purchased a feed mill in the 1960’s. The buildings were built in the 1940’s. Over the years a lot of changes were made to accommodate the growing business. Silos for grain storage, along with tanks and bins for ingredients and feed were added. However, around the 1980’s, the Mill was closed down and became a cattle farm. As time passed, the Mill was abandoned altogether. The Mill was abandoned for many years until 2014, when entrepreneurs Edmund and Ryan Loftus purchased the Mill and started renovations to preserve and share the historical values of the Mill.</p>
